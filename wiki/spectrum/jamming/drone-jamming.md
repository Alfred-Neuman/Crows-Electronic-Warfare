## Jamming
UGV drones can be jammed with a jammer antenna. By default, all UGV vehicles will broadcast a signal between 434MHz and 440MHz. By activating the antenna on the signal with left-mouse button when there is enough signal strength the drones AI will be disabled. The signal has to be higher than -40 for jamming to be possible. As long as you keep having the jammer activated the drone will just stand still where it is and do nothing. So if you jam it and move past it, and stop the jam, the drone will continue with what it was doing before. However, if the drone already spotted you and went into combat, when you stop jamming it will still be in combat. 

```admonish info
When a drone is firing the machine gun it happens in bursts. When you apply the jamming and the AI is halted, it will still finish the round of burst fire before stopping.
