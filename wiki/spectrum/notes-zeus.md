# Notes for Zeus & Mission Makers

* Frequencies will keep showing until either removed by zeus, object is deleted, or object is dead.
* Each frequency is unique, so if you use the same frequency twice, only the last entry will be shown.
* Remember you can hide/show the helping text for what units or objects have signals/sounds/jamming activated, with the keybind of `ctrl+shift+i`. (Keybind can be changed in controls). 
* The EMP will remove the active antenna on the spectrum device, but the spectrum device is "hardened" and will thus not be removed.

# Disable spectrum code for mission makers
If you wish to disable the code controlling the Spectrum Device to use your own, then it can be disabled in addon settings or by setting ``crowsEW_spectrum_spectrumEnable = false;``
