# Radio Chatter Module
The Radio Chatter module is used to "emulate" enemy radio communication for the AI. Put it on an AI and it will randomly within your defined parameters broadcast signal sources for the players to track. If a player listens to the signal a random voice line will be played to simulate you listening in to their comms.

Voicepacks are limited for now due to a lack of languages. Thanks to everyone that has contributed to the voice-packs or will do in the future!
