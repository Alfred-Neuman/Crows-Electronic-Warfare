# C-track

The C-track is a item players can carry in their backpacks and use to attach to an vehicle or themselfs and it will provide a spectrum tracking signal that can be followed with the Spectrum Device on the selected frequency. It makes it possible for players to set trackers without zeus using modules. 

If ACE is loaded it will use the ACE Attach system to attach to vehicles or self, otherwise it will use base-game scroll-menu options.
