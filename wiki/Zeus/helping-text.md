# Helping Text
A keybind has been added to show or hide the helping text for Zeus. The text shows if sound/signal/jamming/radiochatter is applied to the unit or object and helps make it easier to see what units have what. The helping text is only visible for zeus in zeus-view, and only when the zeus-camera is within 500m of the object/unit.

The default keybind is ``ctrl+shift+i`` but it can be changed in keybind options.

```admonish info
If you have entered a different view like ACE arsenal and goes back into zeus-view the text might not show up. If that happens just go out of zeus-view and back into it again and it should work.
```
