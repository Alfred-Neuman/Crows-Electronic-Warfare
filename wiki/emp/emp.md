# General

Module fires an EMP on the selected spot. If no object is chosen an object symbolizing the EMP bomb is spawned and the EMP is fired outwards from that. Its fired with a radius selected by zeus. Players will hear the EMP effect up to twice the distance of the range. However, the effect and shockwave are only felt for players inside the range of the EMP.

Units or vehicles can be set as immune against the EMP with the zeus module. If a vehicle is set to immune any unit inside when the EMP goes off will also be immune.

The EMP will knock out lights, vehicle engines/turrets and other electrical equipment. TFAR SR and LR will still be in inventory, but that specific LR or SL will be unusable from then on. However, picking up another SW or LR that was not affected by EMP will work for the player. (Vehicle radios caught in the blast is also destroyed).

Equipment like GPS, microdagr, minedetector etc. is removed. Any watch other than analog will be replaced with analog watch.

Zeus can decide if any primary or pistol scope with "intergrated NV/Thermal" should be kept, removed or replaced with an aim-point scope. Any other scope is not touched.

Any binoculars that are not the standard binoculars or variants that have no electronics will be either removed or replaced with standard binoculars, depending on the setting set by Zeus. This was the only way to remove the NV/Thermal capabilities while still providing the base magnifying effect.

Some binoculars added by extra mods which are not electrical might still be replaced or removed as I can not cover every single modded item.
